# Chrismasberrypi

A small personal project to go with my [Raspberry Pi Xmas Tree](https://thepihut.com/products/3d-xmas-tree-for-raspberry-pi).

Includes:
- an advent calendar mode and a party mode that triggers automatically on the 25th
- A web interface
- A systemd user service 
- some ssh tunneling shenanigans to access it from everywhere

If you want to use this project you will need to edit some paths manually.
